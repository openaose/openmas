# OpenMAS (Open Multi-Agent System)

The OpenMAS Project explores how to build robust intelligent agents which can interact with each other to solve complex problems.

It follows the Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) paradigm, which guides the development and maintenance of agent-based software. AOSE comprises three aspects or concerns:

* EOP (Environment Oriented Programming)
* OOP (Organisation Oriented Programming)
* AOP (Agent Oriented Programming)

## Framework Features

* Based on Microservices architecture

* Agent Architecture: Mental Agnostic

* Agent Properties: Autonomy | Reactiveness | Proactiveness | Sociability

* Support Environments: First class abstraction // Endogenous

* Support Organisations: First class abstraction // Embodied

* Support Ontologies: RDF

* Security: X.509, Base64, SASL

* Communication: NETWORK | NAME PIPES | Custom
    * Interaction Protocols
    * Message Encodings: ASN.1, JSON, XML
